	<p id = "testinstructions"> On the next page, you will be given a training interface showing your head location and a green area where the sound sources originate. Similar to the testing phase, a sound will be played when the continue button is pressed. You must then click in the green area where you believe this sound is originating from. You will then be shown whether your answer was correct or incorrect. If incorrect, you will be played the sound originating from your guess, and then replayed the original target sound source.
	If you response was incorrect, carry on to the next sound as normal. Once a set accuracy threshold  has been met, you will be taken to the next stage of the experiment. </br>
	All sounds will be played at 0 degree elevation. Please click the button below to continue.</p>
